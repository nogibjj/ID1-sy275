# Project #1: Continuous Integration using GitHub Actions of Python Data Science Project

## Goal

> Duke University IDS 706 Individual Project 1

The project structure must include the following files:
-  Jupyter Notebook with: 
  - Cells that perform descriptive statistics using Polars or Panda.
  - Tested by using nbval plugin for pytest
- Python Script performing the same descriptive statistics using Polars or Panda
- lib.py file that shares the common code between the script and notebook
- Makefile with the following: 
  - Run all tests (must test notebook and script and lib)
  - Formats code with Python black
  - Lints code with Ruff
  - Installs code via: pip install -r requirements.txt
- test_script.py to test script
- test_lib.py to test library
- Pinned requirements.txt
- GitHub Actions performs all four Makefile commands with badges for each one in
the README.md
